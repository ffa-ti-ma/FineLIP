# FineLIP 
This repository is the official implementation of FineLIP

**FineLIP: Extending CLIP‚Äôs Reach via Fine-Grained Alignment with Longer
Text Inputs**

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup 

Refer to the `requirements.txt` file to prepare the environment. 

### Model Training

For model training, run:
```shell
bash train.sh
```
Refer to `train/arguments.py` for all the defined variables. 

### Model Evaluation

#### Short & Long Caption Retrieval
To run retrieval on short caption datasets [COCO2017, Flickr30k] and long caption datasets [DOCCI, Urban1K], run the following command after preparing the data: 

```shell
bash test.sh
```
Set the appropriate variables in the bash file.
